-what is a jsx file?
it is a file that enables using html like elements in javascript.raect uses it for making ui making it easy to structure and read components easily.
-react renders function in html format
-we can create functions/objects outside the main.jsx but it wont display as react has different notations in a object model.
-it wont abide with our key value pairs.
-instead we can create a variable and store a new element using React.createelement method and render it .
